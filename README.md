Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Adnan Karim and I am a Data Scientist and Full Stack Engineer with a passion for using technology to solve complex problems.

I have a strong background in deep learning, with experience working as a research assistant at the School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (SEECS) at NUST in Islamabad, PK. In this role, I have worked on a variety of projects, including using MRI scans to estimate the probability of MGMT promoter in the brain and using DeepLabv3+ for semantic segmentation in agriculture.

In addition to my research experience, I am also a skilled Full Stack Engineer, with experience designing and developing mobile apps and backend systems using technologies such as Figma, React Native, and Express & MongoDB. Currently, I am working as a contract Full Stack Engineer at Airup Limited in London, where I have been responsible for designing and implementing core features of a weather forecasting and hiring app.

In terms of technical skills, I am proficient in a variety of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, and C++, and I have experience using tools and libraries such as AWS Sagemaker, EC2, Scikit-learn, Keras, OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, PyTorch, and TensorFlow.

Thank you for visiting my profile, and please feel free to take a look at my projects to see the work I have done. I am always looking for new opportunities to collaborate and learn, so don't hesitate to reach out!
